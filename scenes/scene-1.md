# Description
You have recently hired a new employee, Sophie, who has joined your team as a GMP specialist. After 8 months, Sophie is showing signs of stress. Sophie is very skilled, dedicated and wants all her tasks to be close to perfection, making high demands on her own performance. As Sophie's manager, you invite her for several talks to discuss prioritisation. Unfortunately, her symptoms seem to getting worse. What is your next move?  

# Choice
Take more frequent 1:1 conversations with Sophie, focusing on how she could prioritise and lower her expectations for her own work. You add: "You are performing very well according to our benchmark."

# Feedback
You chose more 1:1 conversations with Sophie, which support your willingness to dedicate time and resources in developing others. You are also providing Sophie with timely and relevant feedback on how to adjust her work effort in her current role. 

# Outcome

# Choice
You offer Sophie sessions with a stress coach.

# Feedback
Offering Sophie sessions with a stress coach could provide Sophie with some tools for prioritisation. However, it is important that you also follow her development and stress symptoms to make sure her condition is improving.

# Outcome
X

# Choice
You assign Sophie a mentor from among the experienced GMP specialists, making sure that Sophie and the mentor set up some touchdowns. 

# Variables
 - yourself-aware-ownemotions: 0.5
 - bringoutthebest-engage-healthywork: 0.7

# Feedback
Assigning a mentor might be a great way to help Sophie. Hearing from an experienced (and successful) colleague can help Sophie handle her current role. This option gives Sophie the opportunity for relevant feedback and could have a positive impact on the team dynamics.

# Outcome
X

# Choice
You realise that Sophie's high demands for perfection do not match your approach to solving tasks in your team, and probably never will. You decide to start creating a case for her dismissal.

# Variables
 - yourself-authentic-rolemodel: 0.3
 - bringoutthebest-performance-collab: 0.3
 - rolemodel-setdirection-ambitious: 0.5
 
# Feedback
Deciding to lay Sophie off would be jumping to conclusions too soon. You should help give Sophie the best opportunities for self-development and adjusting to her role. 

# Outcome
X
